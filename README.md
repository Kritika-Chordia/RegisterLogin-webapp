# RegisterLogin-webapp
Web application based on register, login, logout features.
Created a Web application using jsp for frontend and servlet calls. java as the base code and mysql for the database connection. Used tomcat to deploy it locally.
Tried to implement login feature for existing account, register for new account, used session to keep track of records, servlet for communications and request-response. feature of logout which will destroy session.
This can be extended to any major project for initial entries.
